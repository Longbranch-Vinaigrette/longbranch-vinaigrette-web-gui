/**Procedural unit
 * 
 * This is not exactly procedural, it's just that the meaning of procedural is closely
 * related to the functionality of this class.
 * 
 * This is intended for when fetching multiple resources from a website, like when you
 * have 1000 repositories on github for example, and you wan't to fetch em' part by
 * part, say on steps of 50 for example.
 * 
 * I will not implement this for now, because I don't need it, just keeping this text
 * as to remember this ephemeral thunk(humorous past participle of think).
